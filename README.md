Tweat üç¥‚ú®
	
Tweat is a modern recipe web app designed to make your cooking experience delightful and personal. Explore a collection of built-in recipes for inspiration, and easily add your own creations to build a customized recipe book. Whether you're a home chef or a foodie, Tweat helps you organize, discover, and share your culinary ideas with ease.

 Tweat, is not an homonym of the old "tweet", but is a "tweak" and a fast way to say "To Eat!" ;)

The pitch is simple, and techy people should get it right away: Tweat, is the git of the kitchen. How? you may say. It's easy: You browse recipes, then you choose one or more, at first we aggregate ingredients, and pre-cooked elements (equivalent to staging), then once that is done, we move to the execution stage (the commit).
