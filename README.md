 Tweat, is not an homonym of the old "tweet", but is a fast way to say "To Eat!" 

The pitch is simple, and techy people should get it right away: Tweat, is the git of the kitchen. How? you may say. It's easy: You browse recipes, then you choose one or more, at first we aggregate ingredients, and pre-cooked elements (equivalent to staging), then once that is done, we move to the execution stage (the commit).
